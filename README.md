## Introduction

<sub>ðŸ¤£ This is my first ever, _nicely-written_ **README-file.** ðŸ¤£</sub>\
<sub>~~(OOps, maybe I shouldn't even have mentioned that.~~</sub>\
BUT:\
My motto is: \ > Do. Or do not. There is no try.\
SO:\
I'm MÃ¡rta Kapocs, from DiÃ³sd, <sub>a small town near Budapest, the capital of Hungary</sub>.\
I live with my husband and our 4 children:

- Bence <img alt="young man playing the drums" src="https://st5.depositphotos.com/1157310/66878/v/450/depositphotos_668785406-stock-illustration-drummer-musician-drumming-drums-detailed.jpg" height=50>

All 4 of them have something to do with music (ie. have performed at prestigious concert halls in Budapest and some in Europe). Now two of them are university students, one is striving to be a professional musician and one is studying in a choir school.\
