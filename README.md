## Introduction

<sub>ü§£ This is my first ever, _nicely-written_ **README-file.** ü§£</sub>\
<sub>~~(OOps, maybe I shouldn't even have mentioned that.)~~</sub>

My motto is:
> Do. Or do not. There is no try.

:point_right:\
I'm M√°rta Kapocs, from Di√≥sd, <sub>a small town near Budapest, the capital of Hungary</sub>.\
I live with my husband and our 4 children:
- B√°lint <img alt="yound man playing the violin" src="resources/YoungManPlayingTheViolin.png" height=50>
- Hanna <img alt="young lady playing the flute" src="resources/YoungLadyPlayingTheFlute.png" height=50>
- Bence <img alt="young man playing the drums" src="resources/YoungManPlayingTheDrums.png" height=50>
- Ilka <img alt="young lady playing the guitar" src="resources/YoungLadyPlayingTheGuitar.png" height=50>

All 4 of them have something to do with :musical_note:music:musical_note: (they have performed at prestigious concert halls in Budapest, some in Europe, + Bence has a little experience in the film industry;-). Now two of them are university students, one is striving to be a professional musician and one is studying at a choir school.\
They are the ones that the previous twenty-some years of my life were mainly about.\
I also like music, plus doing anything connected with Maths and logical thinking. That's why I'm venturing into the field of web-development and **software testing**.
