## Introduction

My motto is:
> Do. Or do not. There is no try.

:point_right:\
I'm M√°rta Kapocs, from Di√≥sd, <sub>a small town near Budapest, the capital of Hungary</sub>.\
I live with my husband and our 4 children:

- Hanna <img alt="young lady playing the flute" src="https://st4.depositphotos.com/3278055/19888/v/450/depositphotos_198886584-stock-illustration-woman-playing-flute.jpg" height=50>
- Bence <img alt="young man playing the drums" src="https://st5.depositphotos.com/1157310/66878/v/450/depositphotos_668785406-stock-illustration-drummer-musician-drumming-drums-detailed.jpg" height=50>
- Ilka <img alt="young lady playing the guitar" src="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/continuous-one-line-drawing-female-sitting-guitarist-playing-guitar-dynamic-musician-artist-performance-concept-single-240666765.jpg?w=992" height=50>

All 4 of them have something to do with music:musical_note: (they have performed at prestigious concert halls in Budapest, some in Europe, + Bence has a little experience in the film industry;-). Now two of them are university students, one is striving to be a professional musician and one is studying at a choir school.\
They are the ones that the previous twenty-some years of my life were mainly about.\
I also like music, plus doing anything connected with Maths and logical thinking. That's why I'm venturing into the field of web-development and **software testing**.
